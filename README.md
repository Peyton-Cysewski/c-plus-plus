# Learning C++
Peyton Cysewski

## Summary
This is my walkthrough of the C++ Progamming Language as guided my it's creator, Bjarne Stroustrup, in *The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition*. (It will be slightly lagging since it was printed in 2013 and will not refence more recent language updates that should be present in C++20). This is not necessarily meant to be a thorough all-encapsulating guide, but more of a reference with short snippets to remind the reader how things work.<br>
<br>

## Guide
Consider this code base a summary of the full book, or at least of the sections with immediate information (starting from chapter 6). Ideally I will at least have something to say for each of the many subsections, but how much will vary based on the information the author provides and how intuitive I think it is. I will try to make the code base read like a page of notes with comments places frequently. Each `.cpp` file will reference a full chapter with commented-out code inside the main funtions that can be run to demonstrate the functionality of the language in action, specific to each section and subsection at hand.


#### Status Updates
- 12/11/20: I have not decided the best way to break the sections up, but will most likely opt to follow the books own structure as it is that most natural way to proceed.
