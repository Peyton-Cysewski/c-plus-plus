# Learning C++
Peyton Cysewski

## Summary
This is my walkthrough of the C++ Progamming Language as guided my it's creator, Bjarne Stroustrup, in *The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition*. (It will be slightly lagging since it was printed in 2013 with the most recent major release being C++ 11 and will not refence more recent language updates that should be present in C++ 20). This is not necessarily meant to be a thorough all-encapsulating guide, but more of a reference with short snippets to remind the reader how things work.<br>
<br>

## Guide
Consider this code base a summary of the full book, or at least of the sections with immediate information (starting from chapter 6). I will provide page numbers for reference, but even though not every word that is written is contained in quotations, I want to make it very clear that this material is fully inspired by Bjarne Stroustrup's book. I will try to make the code base read like a page of notes with comments places frequently. Each `.cpp` file will contain code that will be useful for reference as it can be syntax-highlighted by the reader's IDE for helpful visualization and understanding.


#### Status Updates
- 12/11/20: I have not decided the best way to break the sections up, but will most likely opt to follow the books own structure as it is that most natural way to proceed.
